            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am an aspiring web developer. My programming journey started back in 2018
                 when I discovered the platform 'Scratch', I really liked it and therefore
                I enrolled in programming classes in a school called Coding Academy. This
                has been by far the best coding school I have ever seen. When you go there
                    there is this sense of motivation and the proffessors always have a good
                    attitude. My career really took off in january of 2020 after experimenting
                    for more than 2 years with many other platforms such as Microsoft's Microbit
                    and Make Block's mBot. In January of 2020 I started learning HTML. This
                        event sparked my love, interest, and passion for programming. I saw the
                        world of possibilities that programming offered me and I knew I wanted
                        to do this for a very long time.</p>
